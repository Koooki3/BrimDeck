// of (pixel art). A new theme adds one row to the table, and the theme tests (ThemeCoverageTests) then hold its
// colors to the same contrast as the rest.

// The battery's body: Pill (a rounded outline with a tip), Round (a capsule), Chamfer (HUD cuts across two corners and a tick for
// the tip), Blocks (stepped squares, a segment per tenth).

// while charging, Saver is the mark and outline of Battery saver, Draw the power curve.
// Normal is the text color or a cool one: orange and red belong to the low levels and to nothing else (PowerTests holds every theme to it).
