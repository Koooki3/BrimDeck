// One SMTC session can stand for several media sources of its app. Chrome publishes a single session and
// fills it with whichever tab it considers active, so while a playing tab moves to its next song the session
// briefly carries another tab's title and artwork (a paused video, for instance) before the new song.
// A playing session therefore keeps its song on screen while it reports a different song that is not a
// fresh start (empty, not playing, or playing from well inside its timeline), for at most Hold. A new song
// that starts playing from its beginning, which is what a skip or the end of a song produces, is taken at
// once; anything else that lasts beyond the hold is taken then, so a real switch is only delayed.
