// The pause after rate limited requests to one account endpoint, for one token. The panel asks about once a minute, which is
// what kept a limited account limited. Without a Retry-After the pause grows 2, 4, 8, 16, then 30 minutes with each further 429
// and ends with the first answer that is not one; only this growth has an upper limit. A Retry-After is the server's own time
// and is kept as sent, however long, raised only to MinDelay; a repeated one that is shorter than the growth does not hold the
// pause down. One longer than MaxPlausibleRetryAfter (a week, the longest window a quota has) is taken for a mistake, such as a
// date far in the future or a count of milliseconds read as seconds, and is treated as missing: a wrong value cannot stop the
// quota for good. A little time (up to JitterShare of it) is added, never taken, so several copies of BrimDeck behind one
// address do not retry on the same minute.
// The time of the end is kept, not a countdown, so the pause follows the clock it was set with. If the clock is set back, the
// wait left cannot be longer than the pause was decided to be: it is cut to that length from the new time (RetryAt), instead of
// holding requests back for as long as the clock went back.
