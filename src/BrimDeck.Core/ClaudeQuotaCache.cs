// The last Claude quota read online, kept on disk. Only the account API reports the per-model quotas (Fable and the like) and
// the reset times; the Claude desktop app's local records carry the 5-hour and weekly shares alone. A start while the API is
// rate limited therefore showed two quotas and no Fable page until a request got through. With this file the reading from
// before the restart stands in, as the last reading of the same run already did (UsageService.Freshest).
// It holds the quotas, the plan and when they were read, never a token. A reading older than MaxAge is not used, and a quota
// whose window has reset since is left out: its share no longer says anything.
// It also says which account it was read for, as a hash of the account id (AccountHash), never the id itself. It is used only
// for the same account: after a switch of account while BrimDeck was closed, the other account's quotas and plan would
// otherwise stand in for the new one's. A file that names no account (one written before the hash was kept) or a sign-in
// whose account cannot be told is not used either.
// One account can read several organizations (a personal subscription and a Team, say), each with quotas of its own. The file
// keeps one reading for each, named by a hash of the organization id ("" when the sign-in did not name one); a file of earlier
// versions holds a single reading, which counts as the one of the organization "".
