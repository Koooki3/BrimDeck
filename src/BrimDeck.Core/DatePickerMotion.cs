// The custom date range picker's motion (BrimDeck.ModelDatePicker) as plain functions, so it can be checked without WPF. The
// picker is built once and changes in place, as the system monitor page does: the start and end markers glide between days as
// the monitor's sort pill glides, the range band eases in and out cell by cell, and a month change slides the grid in the
// direction of travel as the panel's page switch does, the old month leaving before the new one arrives so two sets of figures
// never fade over each other.

// The durations in milliseconds: the panel's own feedback timings, which do not follow the animation length chosen in settings
// (the panel's hover and press feedback do not either). A glide is the monitor's sort pill (Soft.Choose), a band, a message or a
// changed date the short swap (Soft.Short), a month leaves in about a seventh of a second and arrives in the monitor's move
// (Soft.Move), and an enabled state eases in the panel's hover time (Soft.Hover).
// Glide: a marker or the active field's outline moving. Band: a cell of the range band. Leave and Arrive: a month change.
// Message: the validation message opening or closing. Enable: a button becoming available or not. Dissolve: a changed date.
