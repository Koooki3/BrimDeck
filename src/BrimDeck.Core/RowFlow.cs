//   - the settings change the width again and again (a slider dragged, a stepper held): the first change is a layout like any

//     quiet for Hold seconds;
// it rises over In seconds when that begins, so the row does not jump to it, and falls over Out seconds when it ends. Without
// animations it is at its target at once. Eased is the flow as the row blends by, smoothstepped so the windows start and stop gently.
