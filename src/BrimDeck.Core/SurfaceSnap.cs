// WPF lays out on the pixel grid (UseLayoutRounding): the island's left margin, its width and the open page's offset inside it (the
// page is centred, so half of what is left over) are each rounded on their own. While the surface moves less than a pixel per frame
// (the opening's tail: the spring's give and its settling) the three cross their half pixels in different frames, so the page, drawn
// at Left + (Width - page) / 2 rounded, stepped one pixel left and right a few times though its place was not changing at all (measured
// offscreen with the real layout: up to four steps, three of them reversals, in the last 30 % of the move at 125 to 175 percent;
// none at 100 percent, where everything is whole already).
//
// The width is taken to the nearest whole pixel of the same parity as the end width, and the left edge to whole pixels about the
// centre the island is travelling to. Then the page's offset (Width - page) / 2 always has the same fraction, Left + that is a
// whole step per step of the width, and no frame rounds the other way: a symmetric opening leaves the page exactly where it will
// stay, and every edge only moves as the curve moves it.
