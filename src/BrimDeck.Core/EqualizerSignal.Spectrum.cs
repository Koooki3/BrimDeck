// The Spectrum way: the bars, left to right, are low to high pitch, so a kick drum lifts the left bars, a cymbal the right ones,
// and a single tone only the bars around its pitch.
//
// One analysis serves any number of bars from 1 to MaxBars (the collapsed and the expanded equalizer are set to different
// lengths). A window of SpectrumWindow samples goes through one FFT; its power is gathered into Bands narrow bands spaced evenly on a
// log axis between LowHz and the top of the audible range; and the bars are made from those narrow bands, as many bars as the
// panel draws, each an equal share of the log axis (BarRange). The narrow bands of the last RangeSeconds are kept, so the bars can
// be made again for another count without starting over: a bar's history, and so its scale, is rebuilt from them (Rebuild).
//
// Each bar is scaled against its own last RangeSeconds (so the treble is not always smaller than the bass, and a wide bar does not
// sit higher than a narrow one just for holding more bins) and against the loudest bar of the moment (so a steady tone keeps
// standing instead of being scaled down to nothing), with the sharpness of a recent rise added on top.
