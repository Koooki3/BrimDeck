//   1. SystemMeter: a meter of the whole platform that Windows exposes through the Energy Meter Interface or the ACPI power meter
//      (the "Energy Meter" and "Power Meter" performance counters). Measured. Few machines have one (some tablets and servers).
//   2. Battery: the power the battery supplies while the machine runs on it (Windows.Devices.Power.Battery's charge rate), which is
//      all that the machine draws, display and fans included. Measured, but only on battery.
//   3. Components: the processor package (RAPL, through the Energy Meter counters), memory where it has a meter of its own, and each
//      graphics adapter that reports its board power (NVIDIA through the driver's nvidia-smi). A sum of what can be read: the display, drives, fans,
//      other chips and the power supply's losses are not in it, so it is labelled an estimate and never shown as a measurement.
//   4. None: the reading says why there is none, and the page shows a dash with that reason.
