// Turns a player's audio into the levels of the level bars, in one of two ways (EqualizerMode, asked for by Fill):
//
//   Flow (the original, EqualizerSignal.Flow.cs): the sound is made into one value, and the bars show it at increasing delays, left
//   to right, so a drum beat or a voice is seen flowing along them.
//   Spectrum (EqualizerSignal.Spectrum.cs): the sound is split by pitch, and each bar is one band of it, low on the left.
//
// Both read the same samples. Only the way being shown is analysed, so Flow costs what it always did, and the Spectrum's work
// (a longer FFT, 60 narrow bands and their histories) is not done, nor is its memory taken, until it is asked for. Changing the way
// while the sound plays carries the bars over: until the new way has made its first analysis the bars are the old way's, and the
// new way then starts from where they stood.
