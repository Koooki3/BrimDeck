// The vendor protocols the devices page reads batteries with, as bytes in and readings out: building each request and parsing
// each reply, with no I/O, so every one is tested against the bytes it is documented with. The app's HID layer
// (Native/HidBatteries.cs) sends them. Sources, by protocol:
// - Logitech HID++ 2.0: after device-battery-viewer by CharlesGool (https://github.com/CharlesGool/device-battery-viewer,
//   MIT License; see ThirdPartyNotices.txt), whose flow, battery features and voltage curve are ported; the HID++ 1.0 battery
//   registers and the 0x1F20 headset feature are from the protocol as the Linux kernel and Solaar describe it (facts only).
// - Razer: after razer-battery-report by Timofey Gelazoniya (https://github.com/xzeldon/razer-battery-report, MIT License;
//   see ThirdPartyNotices.txt): the 90-byte report, its checksum and the catalog of models and transaction ids.
// - ATK/VXE (Nordic "BitMouse") and Compx frames: after Lkig/ATK-A9-Battery and cobanov/atkctl (MIT); Inphic IN9: after
//   InphicBatteryTray by Tan-TanZi (MIT). See ThirdPartyNotices.txt.
// - AJAZZ / AJ179 (XCTECH 249A:5C2F receiver, documented wired 248A:5C2E/5D2E/5E2E): interrupt report framing after
//   Rockeyxx/aj179-linux (MIT; see ThirdPartyNotices.txt) and a read-only PoC on a 249A:5C2F / M041 dongle — not the AJ 8K
//   Feature 0xF7 path.
// - SteelSeries, HyperX and MCHOSE headsets, MCHOSE mice, VGN keyboards, Endgame Gear, VAXEE, Nordic receivers and the
//   PlayStation controllers: written from the documented bytes alone (HeadsetControl, the Linux drivers and the vendors' own
//   web drivers are look-only).
// - After HaloBattery (https://github.com/HeyOkay/HaloBattery, MIT; see ThirdPartyNotices.txt): the Compx 17-byte frame's
//   reply rules (pulsar.py), the 0x83 feature exchange of WLmouse, G-Wolves, LAMZU and the MCHOSE A5 Pro Max with its model
//   lists, the MCHOSE RealTek and G7 exchanges (mchose.py), the HyperX Cloud III, III S and Alpha 2 requests, the NZXT Lift
//   Elite's telemetry, SteelSeries's mouse replies (steelseries.py), the Razer keyboards' transaction ids and interfaces, the
//   Corsair receivers' get-property exchange (corsair.py) and the JBL Quantum 910's reports (jbl.py).
// - After vigil-watt (https://github.com/evren-oct/vigil-watt, MIT): the ATK, HECATE and VGN collections for the Compx frame,
//   the LINGBAO M5PRO Max, CHERRY PIXIU75 and HECATE G5M Pro reads, the MCHOSE G3 V2 query, the ROG Delta II headset, the ROG
//   Omni receiver's pairing table, and the DELUX, Inphic ZHEN, Rapoo, AULA G9 and HyperX Cloud Flight 2 reports.
// - Rapoo's first generation: after mousectl's rapoo_vt3pro driver (https://github.com/D3m0nZOnFire/mousectl, MIT).
// - SteelSeries mice: rivalcfg's device profiles (https://github.com/flozz/rivalcfg, WTFPL). Beken (Attack Shark) receivers:
//   after incconutwo's and misaka310's mouse-battery-tray (MIT). Rapoo: also Iris-0109's rapoo-tray (MIT). The LAMZU Inca on
//   the 0x83 exchange: Fan4Metal's mouse_tray and MouseDock's device table (MIT) list it.
// - ASUS ROG and TUF and the Omni receiver's model ids (G-Helper, GPL), the Ninjutso receiver and the rest of the Compx model
//   table (Fan4Metal's mouse_tray, no license), the Steam Controller puck's reports (SDL) and the PULSE 3D's status report
//   (HeadsetControl, GPL): facts only, the code written from the documented bytes.
// - AirPods and Beats: the proximity pairing advertisement's layout as OpenPods and AirPodsDesktop read it (GPL; look-only,
//   facts only).

// One battery reading from a protocol: the percentage (null: the device answered without one), whether it charges, whether
