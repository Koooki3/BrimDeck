// Drop-downs, lists and pickers open and close as the panel's cards do (Soft.Enter, Soft.Leave). WPF closes a pop-up at
// once, also when it closes itself on a click outside, so its closing is shown by a picture of its last frame, which leaves
// while the real one is already gone and the click has done what it was meant for. The picture is shown in a pop-up of its
// own that is opened as soon as the real one has been laid out: a pop-up created at the moment of closing came up some 50 ms
// later, after a blank. It lies right beneath the real one and is kept up to date while that is open, so it already shows
// when WPF takes the real one away: given its picture only on closing, it was drawn a frame late and the list blinked out
// and back before it left. It is first taken once the list has entered, and then again only when the list can have changed
// (motion-review F7, BrimDeck.Core.PopupPicture): the pointer moved onto another element, a button or key went down or up, or
// the list scrolled; once right after (the change's own frame) and once more when a hover's fade has settled. A change while it
// entered is taken the same way right after the first picture. Taken 20 times a second while open, it kept the list rendering in
// software.
