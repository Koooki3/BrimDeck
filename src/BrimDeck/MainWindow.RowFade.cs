// picture and fades out over the new one, which fades in: the readings that stay do not move and the ones that come or go dissolve
// (the same of a style's readings turned on or off altogether, and of the panel's scale, which draws the whole row at another size).
// Nothing else rebuilds the row with a different choice of readings:
// a resize, a clock tick or a reading's own figures keep the same key and build the row as before.
