// panel that had peaked at over 200 MB stayed there. Once every panel has been collapsed and left alone for a while, the heap is
// compacted, the room it no longer needs is returned, and the working set is trimmed. Never while a panel is open or a surface
// is being resized, and at most every few minutes: what is trimmed comes back from memory on the next use, which must not
// fall on an opening panel's first frames.
