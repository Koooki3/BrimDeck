// The island's shadow is drawn from a cached picture (ShadowHost's BitmapCache). WPF does not keep an effect's output: whenever
// anything drawn over the shadow changes (the scrolling title, the equalizer, a carousel, the readings), it draws the shadow's
// subtree again and blurs it again, on every frame of that motion. The cache keeps the blurred picture, so those frames only
// compose it. While the island changes size the picture would be made again on every frame, which costs more than blurring
// directly, so the cache is dropped then and comes back once the size has held still for a moment. The same holds while what
// the picture shows changes in place (the surface color, the corners), and while the shadow is not shown at all there is
// nothing to keep. The shadow fades on ShadowHost, outside the cache, so a fade only composes the kept picture.
