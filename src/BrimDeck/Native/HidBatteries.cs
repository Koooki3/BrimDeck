// The batteries that only the devices' own protocols tell, over HID: Logitech receivers and cables (HID++), Razer mice and
// keyboards, the 2.4 GHz mice and keyboards of ATK, VXE, VGN, Pulsar, MCHOSE, Endgame Gear, VAXEE, Inphic, AJAZZ, WLmouse,
// G-Wolves, LAMZU, Ninjutso, LINGBAO, NZXT, CHERRY and HECATE (those whose vendor and product are known), ASUS ROG mice,
// keyboards and headsets (the ROG Omni receiver's paired devices too), SteelSeries mice, Rapoo's first generation, SteelSeries,
// HyperX and MCHOSE headsets, Corsair's receivers (CorsairReader), the receivers that send their battery unasked (Attack Shark,
// DELUX, Inphic ZHEN, Rapoo, AULA G9, the Steam Controller puck, JBL Quantum 910, PULSE 3D, Cloud Flight 2: only listened to,
// PushEvents), PlayStation controllers, and any device that carries the standard HID battery usages. The protocols themselves
// are in Core (DeviceProtocols.cs); this sends them. Every request only reads: nothing is set on any device (a Logitech
// receiver's wireless notices aside, HidppEvents).
// One worker thread at below normal priority does the I/O, so a slow device never holds the panel, while the page or the
// collapsed reading shows (DeviceDemand.Watch), and not at all otherwise, when it lets every handle go and ends (the next start
// makes a new one). Each kind is read as often as DevicePolling has it: the brands that only answer when asked every 15
// seconds, the PlayStation controllers (only listened to) every 5, and the Logitech devices every 30, their own events
// (HidppEvents) bringing a change in between at once. Two threads of their own take what would hold that pass: the receivers
// that send their battery unasked are listened to all the time (PushEvents), each reading standing until the device sends
// another, and the Corsair receivers, whose answer takes seconds, are read once a minute (CorsairReader); both hand their
// readings back to the worker, which lists them at once. A device or a cable plugged in or pulled out has every device read
// again within a moment, and twice more a few seconds later (a watcher over the HID collections); so do the computer waking
// and the user coming back (ReadNow). On Bluetooth, only the collections a reader here speaks to are opened (Spoken).
