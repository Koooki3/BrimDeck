// The frame rate of the program in front, for the collapsed row and the system monitor page: one figure for every panel, with the
// program's name. The frames each program presents are read from Windows' event tracing, as PresentMon reads them (GameTechDev/
// PresentMon, MIT License): the DXGI runtime's Present start (DirectX 10 to 12, event 42), the D3D9 runtime's (DirectX 9 and WPF,
// event 1), and the graphics kernel's present history record (event 171), which also covers OpenGL and Vulkan. The runtimes' are
// counted by swap chain (the event's first field), and a DXGI present with DXGI_PRESENT_TEST (flag 1, which only asks whether the
// window shows) is not counted. A program's figure is its busiest swap chain or its kernel count, whichever is larger: a program
// with two windows is not counted twice, nor a frame counted by both the runtime and the kernel. These are the frames a program
// submits, as Steam's and other games' counters show them: one that does not wait for the display (sync interval 0, as Chromium
// and Electron present; Claude submitted 101 to 115 frames a second on a 60 Hz display while it redrew) submits more frames than the
// display shows, and the compositor drops the rest, so it may read above the refresh rate, as an uncapped game does. The frames the
// display itself takes are not counted: they include everything that moves on it (a chat writing, BrimDeck's own panel), not one
// program.
// The desktop and the taskbar in front show the desktop's own frames: a live wallpaper (Wallpaper Engine, Lively) draws in a
// window of its own inside the desktop's (a child of Progman or WorkerW not owned by explorer), so that program's frame rate and
// name show; behind a still wallpaper, the desktop (explorer's own frames, near none).
// Only these three events are asked for (an event ID filter), so the session costs little: about 1 ms of processor time a second
// with two displays drawing at 60 frames a second each, and the compositor's and the kernel's own did not rise; counting frames by
// capturing the screen (Windows Graphics Capture) took about 39 ms here and raised the compositor's by a third of a percent of the
// machine, so it is not used.
// Reading the events takes membership of the Performance Log Users group (or an elevated process); without it the session is
// refused and there is no frame rate (State None): the collapsed row leaves the reading out and the page's line shows a dash.
// Which program: the one whose window is in front. A browser or an Electron app draws in a child process of the same executable,
// and an app built on WebView2 in msedgewebview2.exe children, so a window whose own process presents nothing takes the frames of
// such descendants; any other descendant is a program of its own (everything started from the desktop descends from explorer).
// A UWP app's window (Settings) is ApplicationFrameHost's frame around the app's own, so the app's process counts (Owner).
// While the program in front presents nothing (a chat beside a game on another display), the figure stays with the last program
// that did, so it does not drop to 0 at every click; once that one has stopped too, the program in front shows, at 0.
// The session is named for this process ("BrimDeck Frames 1234"): a test or a second copy has a session of its own, and a session
// stopped by anything else is started again (Sample, at most every few seconds). Sessions left by a BrimDeck that has ended are
// stopped when a session starts, as Windows keeps a session until it is stopped and has few of them.
// Want is called on the UI thread, Sample on the sampler's; the events arrive on a thread of their own.
