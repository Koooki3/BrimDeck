// Guards the readings that ask a device's driver directly (SensorStops). Ask marks a reading as being asked: in memory always, and
// on disk for the first readings of a device in a run (every drive temperature), written through to the disk before the driver is
// asked, so the mark survives a machine that freezes and is restarted. Start, at the next run, turns a mark left behind into a stop.
// A reading still unanswered after SensorStops.StuckSeconds is stopped at once; its thread cannot be freed, so the caller is told
// (stuck) and starts another in its place, and the old thread, should the driver ever answer, ends with ReadingAbandoned.
// Clocks are not used for the wait: the watch counts its own ticks, so a machine that sleeps through a reading wakes to one tick.
