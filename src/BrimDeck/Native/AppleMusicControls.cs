// Shuffle, repeat and seeking for Apple Music, whose media session reports all three as unavailable. They go through the
// shuffle button, the repeat button and the progress bar of its main window, found by their automation ids, so they work
// only while that window exists and may stop working when Apple Music changes its interface. The bar counts whole
// seconds; writing it moves playback (measured: 157 to 167). UI Automation calls into another process and can take a
// while, so every call runs on the thread pool, one at a time. All three sit in the window's transport bar (17 elements
// against about 450 for the whole window), which is looked up once and kept, so the rest of the window is not walked
// again on every reading; while it is not found it is looked for again at most every 10 seconds.
